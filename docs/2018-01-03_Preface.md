#Preface

## Hello there!

This is something new to me. Not only writing blog-posts, but also 1) an internship and 2) being so far away from "home" (roughly 800km) for several months. So stay with me while we discover this together.

First of all:

    $ whoami

My name is Jan (aka. [JayVii](https://www.jayvii.de)), I am currently 22 years old and just finished my Bachelor's studies in economics in Germany's oldest town: [Trier](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/31941291). However, economics haven't been the only topic I am into. In fact, my specialisations focused on two things:

* empirical / statistical analysis
* political economics

But apart from that, I am also greatly interested in technology, [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) in particular. And I also care an awful lot about privacy, citizen's rights and how to enable people to protect themselves about the growing trend towards data-mining. This has a bunch of contact points with my studies, so it was only logical to me, to reach out and find some place I can contribute towards projects that do exactly that, while also improving my skills.

And I suceeded. I became an intern at the [Free Software Foundation Europe](https://fsfe.org/), starting next week, until April of this year. I am really excited about what my particular tasks will be and I'll make sure to keep you up-to-date here...

I already got a teaser for you, though: I'll support the FSFE at [FOSDEM 2018](https://fosdem.org/2018/) in Brussels :)

I am not sure yet, how frequent I will populate this blog, but I'll try my best. If you want smaller and more frequent updates, make sure to follow me on [Twitter (boooooooh!)](https://twitter.com/JayVii_de) or [the fediverse](https://mastodon.social/@JayVii_de).

**Cheers!**
